/**
 * Flags which enable or disable specific events from the discord gateway.
 *
 * <p>The way to use these is very simple. Go through each intent in the following list and decide whether your bot
 * will need these events or not.
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>GUILD_MEMBERS This is a <b>privileged</b> gateway intent that is used to update user information and join/leaves (including kicks)</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_BANS This will only track guild bans and unbans</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_EMOJIS This will only track guild emote create/modify/delete. Most bots don't need this since they just use the emote id anyway.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_INVITES This will only track invite create/delete. Most bots don't make use of invites since they are added through OAuth2 authorization by administrators.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_VOICE_STATES Required to properly get information of members in voice channels and cache them. <u>You cannot connect to a voice channel without this intent</u>.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_PRESENCES This is a <b>privileged</b> gateway intent this is only used to track activity and online-status of a user.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_MESSAGES This is used to receive incoming messages in guilds (servers), most bots will need this for commands.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS This is used to track reactions on messages in guilds (servers). Can be useful to make a paginated embed or reaction role management.</li>
 *     <li>GUILD_MESSAGE_TYPING This is used to track when a user starts typing in guilds (servers). Almost no bot will have a use for this.</li>
 *     <li>DIRECT_MESSAGES This is used to receive incoming messages in private channels (DMs). You can still send private messages without this intent.</li>
 *     <li>DIRECT_MESSAGE_REACTIONS This is used to track reactions on messages in private channels (DMs).</li>
 *     <li>DIRECT_MESSAGE_TYPING This is used to track when a user starts typing in private channels (DMs). Almost no bot will have a use for this.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * If an intent is not specifically mentioned to be <b>privileged</b>, it is not required to be on the whitelist to use this event.
 * To get whitelisted you either need to contact discord support (for bots in more than 100 guilds)
 * or enable it in the developer dashboard of your application.
